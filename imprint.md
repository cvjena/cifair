### Google Analytics

Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Ireland Limited ("Google") is used on this website.
The use includes the "Universal Analytics" operating mode.
This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user's activities across devices.

Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users interact with the site.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
However, if IP anonymisation is activated, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand.
We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended to include IP anonymisation in order to ensure anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).
The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
For more information on terms of use and data protection, please visit [https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html) or [https://policies.google.com/?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/?hl=en).
